I am a PhD student in economics at the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics). My primary research interests are in public economics, environmental economics, and development economics.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a predoctoral fellow for [Raj Chetty](https://rajchetty.com/) at [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/), Harvard University, where I researched the causal effect of social connections on economic opportunity using Facebook data. I was also employed as a consultant in the World Bank's Development Impact Evaluation Unit, and as a Fast Stream Economist for the UK Government Economic Service.

I hold a BSc in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from the University of Warwick, an MPhil in Development Studies from the University of Cambridge, and an MASc in Data, Economics and Development Policy from MIT.
